## Aim
In some cases a portfolio website is the first time a prospective employer or client has the opportunity to form an opinion about me and who I am. In general the portfolio website is another piece in the puzzle of who I am as a person and web developer.

## Design Direction

With the aim in mind I wanted my portfolio website to be simple and clean looking but sharp to begin with. My website is something that I will add to and build overtime as my skills as a web developer continue to grow.

I Searched through pinterest with the following search terms for some design direction.

- Clean designs (the design direction)
- Workhard Anywhere (my fave slogan/moto which I attribute to my future as a web dev)
- Melbourne (where I live)
- New York (one of my favorite cities)
- Greece and Mauritius (my heritage)

I then searched around online for inspiration from other websites.

I found the website of a creative agency called Blend which drove the inspiration for a modern, simple yet clean look.

And also the portfolio website of hannah bourke, a student at coder academy from the previous intake.

## Usability and Heuristics
Usability for my site as it is should be rather simplistic as it is a one page scroll down. On the main / home page I will include an animated down arrow to inform scroll direction.

## Initial Design
My initial designs began with images and colors of city scapes and skylines. I also really liked the Workhard Anywhere grayscale image which I used on my home page.

I decided on Montserrat and Ubuntu as font choices. Both fonts are sans serif and very clean and modern. Color choices (Gold and Purple) weren't really working so went with a grayscale pallete to begin with.

Font Choices - Montserrat and Ubuntu

## Logo
My name isn't an easy one to put into a logo, at least I found it a struggle. So I used my whole name. The font used is Montserrat.

Logo colors decided on yellow/gold on a greyish greenish background to enhance the yellow/gold.

## Changes
Not entirely happy with the direction the design was heading. Too plain and colorless.

Continued searching online for some ideas.
Came across the website of web designer Matt Farley.
I liked his color choices and clean design. Exactly what I was wanting for the look of my website.

## Development process
I went with a five column css grid for the style structure for responsiveness.

## More Changes

As a link back to my career history in the automotive industry my home page included a car that transitioned in view to make it look like it drove into the frame.

It was suggested to me that this looked more like a website for a car salesman. I followed this advice and replaced the car with a quote.

Decided not to include a menu due to currently being such a simple small site.

## Quotes
I have included two of my favorite quotes in my website.
"If you love what you do then you will never work a day in your life." which was one of my motivations for changing career and "Workhard Anywhere" which I attribute to my career as a web developer.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was the design process. I realised from this assignment that I am leaning more to the backend side of web development.

Getting the css grid to work, three attempts.
