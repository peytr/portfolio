## Aim
In some cases a portfolio website is the first time a prospective employer or client has the opportunity to form an opinion about me and who I am. In general the portfolio website is another piece in the puzzle of who I am as a person and web developer.

## Design Direction

With the aim in mind I wanted my portfolio website to be clean, minimal yet sharp and sophisticated. I also wanted to keep my portfolio website simple to start with as this is something I will add to and build overtime as I grow and develop new skills as a web developer.

I wanted to impose a slight feel of maturity as I am coming into this industry at a more mature age than the average junior web developer.
I also felt it was important to add a little hint of where I have been in my life career wise which is why I eventually ended up with a car appearing on the home page.

I found the website of a creative agency called Blend which drove the inspiration for a modern, simple yet clean look.

And also the portfolio website of hannah bourke, a student at coder academy from the previous intake.

## Logo
My name isn't an easy one to put into a logo, at least I found it a struggle. So I used my whole name. The font used is Montserrat.

## Colours and Fonts
My initial designs began with images of city scapes and skylines portraying colors of style and sophistication, I also went with a grayscale image of calming waters for my main page.

I very quickly decided on Montserrat and Ubuntu as font choices. Both fonts are sans serif and very clean and modern. But I couldn't get comfortable with color choice which shows in my first design, colourless, even though the images I chose were full of colour. Perhaps that was the issue, too much colour to choose from.

Not entirely happy with the direction the design was heading.

So back to the internet for some more inspiration.
I eventually came across the website of web designer Matt Farley.

## Taglines
A little while back during the first few weeks of the bootcamp I came across the slogan and wallpapers "Workhard Work Anywhere"
This immediatley resinated with me as I like to think that I always work hard at what I do plus I attribute the "work anywhere" with the world of web development and coding in general. It is a skill that enables you to literaly work anywhere, at least anywhere with a good internet connection.

## Final Design
Following the design and color scheme of Matt Farley's website. Loved his layout and especially his colours. So this is the design flavor I followed.

As mentioned adding in the car to highlight my automotive career history.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was the design process. I realised from this assignment that I am leaning more to the backend side of web development.
